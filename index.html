            <h3>Space Flight</h3>
            <div>Frimout flew as a payload specialist on STS-45 Atlantis (24 March to 2 April 1992). STS-45 was launched
                from and returned to land at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida. It was the first Spacelab mission
                dedicated to NASA's Mission to Planet Earth. During the nine-day flight, the crew aboard Atlantis
                operated the twelve experiments that constituted the ATLAS-1 (Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications
                and Science) cargo. ATLAS-1 obtained a vast array of detailed measurements of atmospheric chemical and
                physical properties, which contributed significantly to improving our understanding of our climate and
                atmosphere. In addition, this was the first time an artificial beam of electrons was used to stimulate a
                man-made auroral discharge. At mission conclusion, Frimout had traveled 3.2 million miles in 143 Earth
                orbits and logged over 214 hours in space. His flight made him instantaneously very famous in Belgium
                and triggered what was called Frimout-mania[7]. Prince Philippe of Belgium talked with him when he was
                in space and a ticker tape parade was organized when he came back to Belgium.</div>
